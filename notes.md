I decided that I wanted to keep working on the game I made last week to see how realistic I could make it. By that I mean, can I place things the way they are in real life? Can I add aspects from my experience, like the bugs crawling around? Can I do that with other peoples sites too?

The goal will be to have as many of the locations as possible from out recorded data (I know super ambitious, but it's ok if I only get a few done too. The idea will be to have the overall experience of our world in a virtual setting)

So I present to you my process for The Graveyard Project 2.0!

## Day 1

Alrighty, so today I tried to make an intro room and then lead people into the first site which is going to be mine (St James Cemetery). 
I wanted to make the wall interactive, but from what I can tell the only way to do that is by making each tile seperatly, Which will become too much very fast. 
I also realized that the best way to keep track will be to label everything as best I can to know which site it belongs to, and maybe make the tombs a bit different with each site. But I'm not sure if I want to do that yet.
I also played with the item section (the tombs are sprites), and was so excited to interact with the objects, but I quickly discovered they disapear after you interact with them. So I decided to make my trees and benches spirits too, because I want them to stay in the game. 
I would also like to make different objects different colours, aka tombs gray, trees green, benches brown, etc. 

I think I have an idea for the items section! I will add water bottles and lunch boxes that people can 'collect' to mimic our real life exerience with the sites, where we sat and ate, and drank lots of water as we spent hours looking at various tombs.

I was able to figure out the exits fairly fast, and I think I will make them two way exits just in case people want to go back. I'll finalize that aspect later on.

## Day 2

I added Cocochantal's page to the game next because she was so kind and shared all of her points for me in an excel sheet. To help me visuallize, I took the first 10 (I don't have space for more with the current map layout) and plugged them into google maps. I then saved each point to my personal account on google so that it would pin it for me and added the names for each point so as not to lose track. Once I did that I created the 10 tombs and the sign for the map and then also added so architectural features that were visible through google maps satalite. 

In comparison to my map it looks much more realistic, but I had no large monuments or architectural features near the tombs I recorded, so there is not much I can do about that. 

I would also like to expand the page for cocochantal's tombs because she has about 10 more points that can be added, but I have yet t ofind a way to make that a reality. I have asked the discord page if anyone was able to do this so we shall see. 

Another thing I would like to note is the labelling system. It is not so helpful that I labelled everything based on what it was and which location I wanted it to be in so that I wouldn't get confused and have to read each dialog to ensure that it is in the right place. However, even with all of my labels, I find that it is starting to get harder to make sure I have everthing in the right spot, or that I haven't accidently misplaced one of the sprites
