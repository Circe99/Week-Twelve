I decided that I wanted to keep working on the game I made last week to see how realistic I could make it. By that I mean, can I place things the way they are in real life? Can I add aspects from my experience, like the bugs crawling around? Can I do that with other peoples sites too?

So I present to you my process for The Graveyard Project 2.0!

## Day 1

Alrighty, so today I tried to make an intro room and then lead people into the first site which is going to be mine (St James Cemetery). 
I wanted to make the wall interactive, but from what I can tell the only way to do that is by making each tile seperatly, Which will become too much very fast. 
I also realized that the best way to keep track will be to label everything as best I can to know which site it belongs to, and maybe make the tombs a bit different with each site. But I'm not sure if I want to do that yet.
I also played with the item section (the tombs are spirits), and was so excited to interact with the objects, but I quickly discovered they disapear after you interact with them. So I decided to make my trees and benches spirits too, because I want them to stay in the game. 
I would also like to make different objects different colours, aka tombs gray, trees green, benches brown, etc. 

I think I have an idea for the items section! I will add water bottles and lunch boxes that people can 'collect' to mimic our real life exerience with the sites, where we sat and ate, and drank lots of water as we spent hours looking at various tombs.

I was able to figure out the exits fairly fast, and I think I will make them two way exits just in case people want to go back. I'll finalize that aspect later on.
