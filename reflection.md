# Weekly Work

This module was the perfect way to wrap up all the work we did througout the term. I also like the opportunity to express the date in my own way, which allows me to consider the same things I considered thoughout the term. What points are important? Why are they important? What is the goal of the game? Does it send the message I want it to? Is it ethical? Etc.

"We're sometimes at risk of sharing information which isn't ours to share." - Dr. Graham week 9

This was as relivent in week 9 as it is now. There will always be issues with sharing this data, and because my game is open source (so really anyone who finds my github can access it and play if they would like), I wanted to simulate a game that was as realistic to the real world and our experience with these sites as possible, while still keeping it generic. So instead of making tombs that looked like those at the site, I made a standard so make them all even and the inscriptions are all the same. This also helps keep the game consistant so I believe it works better with the style of game, and the experience I wanted to get across.

The readings throughout the modules, did not resonate to the same extent with me this module. I found that activities were far more thought provocing to me, and that is likely because of the previous readings I did, and my other reflection which have followed me all the way through to this last week of content. 

To conclude this module, I found that it allowed for much more freedom to explore with different things, but with that it also comes with lots of responsibility. We have to be sure that we are still respectful of the way we share the data. And we have to be aware of the data we share and why we chose that information over other aspects.

# Fails and Wins

My win this module was finding the perfect way to express the data we gathered this term (for me). I found that the game I made worked out really well and created the experience that I was going for. I was able to recreated experiences that we had while out gathering data, and because we were not all able to experience the data collecting section together, I waned to make a form where everyone could experience or re-experience what happened at different sites. 

But this leads me to my fail this module, which I would first like to say is NO ONES FAULT! I was unable to make the game with levels for every location due to the lack of data that I was using to create the game. But nonetheless I was able to gather some of the data I needed. I now wonder if I would be able to make any changes to the game had I known earlier that the data was not sufficient. Would it have influenced my game?
